# sensorX-ESP8266
Operation system for wireless sensor based on ESP8266

## Abstract
The original motivation came from an idea to monitor temperature, humidity, air pressure and power consumption in a garage.

After playing around with a couple of ESP8266 boards for a while, it was obvious that i need to tie all the various pieces together into one solid solution. 

Here it is - _sensorX_.
